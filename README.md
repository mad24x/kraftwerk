Next Steps and Recommendations:

Target Identified Groups:

  Focus on the demographic and behavioral groups identified to achieve a higher overall acceptance rate.
  Tailor coupon distribution strategies to target drivers who are more likely to accept them based on their habits and characteristics.

Share Insights with Businesses:

  Provide businesses with detailed analysis reports to demonstrate how targeting specific groups and optimizing expiration dates can increase coupon acceptance.
  Collaborate with businesses to identify low-volume days and strategically push out coupons to boost customer traffic during these times.

Optimize Coupon Distribution:

  Avoid distributing coupons on high-volume days to prevent overwhelming businesses with excess traffic.
  Use data-driven insights to align coupon delivery with business needs and customer behavior patterns for maximum effectiveness.

Test and Refine Strategies:

  Continuously monitor acceptance rates and adjust strategies based on real-time data and feedback.

Customer Feedback:

  Gather feedback from customers who accept and use the coupons to understand their preferences and motivations.
  Use this feedback to improve the design and appeal of future coupons.

Incorporate Seasonal Trends:

  Analyze seasonal trends and adjust coupon distribution strategies accordingly to maximize acceptance rates during different times of the year.
